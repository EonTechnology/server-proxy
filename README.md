# Peer security complex
The security complex is designed to protect peer from excessive activity in the network. It canâ€™t fully protect the peer from all kinds of attacks, but from excessive activity will protect.

## Getting Started
### Install first:
* docker
* docker-compose

### Installation:
* `git clone ...`
* `cd ...`
* `git submodule init`
* `git submodule update`

### Setting
To participate in the generation of blocks, before the start of the peer is need to set the environment variable `SECRET_SEED` with the SEED account, on whose behalf the blocks will be generated.

The environment variables for docker-compose also can be specified in the `.env` file (located in the current working directory):
```
SECRET_SEED=...
```

### Launching
Peer will be launched automatically together with the security complex.

Simple launching:
```
docker-compose up
```

Launching with `SECRET_SEED` specified directly in the start command:
```
SECRET_SEED=... docker-compose up
```

Launching in the background:
```
docker-compose up -d
```

### Updating peer-server
To update the code base of the peer, is necessary to execute in the project folder:
```
git submodule update
```
